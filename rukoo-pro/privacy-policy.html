  <h1>Privacy Policy for Rukoo Pro</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: 2025</p>
  <p>Rukoo Pro ("the App") is a Muslim prayer times, Qibla direction, and prayer tracking app. This policy describes what data the App uses and how it is handled.</p>

  <h2>Data We Collect and Use</h2>
  <h3>Location</h3>
  <p>The App uses your device location (with your permission) to calculate prayer times, show Qibla direction, and help you find nearby mosques. Location is processed on your device and sent only to trusted services to compute prayer times. We do not sell or share your location with advertisers.</p>

  <h3>Data Stored on Your Device</h3>
  <p>Your prayer log and settings (e.g. calculation method, adhan notifications) are stored only on your device. They are not sent to our servers.</p>

  <h3>No Account Required</h3>
  <p>You can use the App without creating an account. We do not collect your name, email, or phone number unless you contact us for support.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The App may use external APIs (e.g. for prayer times) and your device’s maps app when you search for mosques. Their privacy policies apply to data sent to them.</p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App does not knowingly collect personal data from children. It is suitable for all ages.</p>

  <h2>Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy from time to time. The "Last updated" date will be revised when we do.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>For questions about this privacy policy, please use the support contact listed in the App Store listing.</p>
